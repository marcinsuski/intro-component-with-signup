## HTML 
Pretty basic structure. I'm trying to add as many landmark and semantic elements as possible, still needed some divs for the form for proper styling. 


## CSS
I'm practicing:
- Flexbox
- responsive layout: relative sizing (rem, em instead of px) and sizing ranges ( clamp() to make content even more responsive)
- @media queries (as little as possible, but required by challenge rules)

## JS
- form validation for every input
- individual email validation using RegEx
- adding styling and injecting text using JS
